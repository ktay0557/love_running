The site was written using mobile first design, with responsiveness added in once it was fully functional on mobile phones.

There are multiple pages, providing the user with details of the various runs available,
images from current runners participating in runs, and a sign up page to allow new users to join.

## Testing

The project was validated using the W3C Markup and CSS Validators, in order to ensure that the project contained no errors.

The W3C CSS Validator gave a warning in regards to a missing section heading on the Gallery page. A hidden heading was added to ensure the layout was not compromised.

In the future, I would like to add the ability for users to post their own images with a feature to comment on the images.
